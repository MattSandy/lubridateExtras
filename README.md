Convenience functions for the lubridate package

<!-- Placeholder for build status, CRAN status, and coverage status -->

## Overview

Lubridate makes it easier to work with date-time data in R and provides
new capabilities. LubridateExtras builds on top of lubridate to provide
a number of convenience functions, primarily focused on abstracting
patterns in ways that improve code readability and reduce copying and
pasting code.

## Installation

``` r
# lubridateExtras is not currently on CRAN
# Please install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ellisvalentiner/lubridateExtras")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example
on [github](https://github.com/ellisvalentiner/lubridateExtras/issues).

## Usage

``` r
library(lubridateExtras)

yesterday()
#> [1] "2018-02-20"

tomorrow()
#> [1] "2018-02-22"

days_ago(7)  # equivalent to lubridate::today() - lubridate::days(7)
#> [1] "2018-02-14"
(7 %>% days_ago) # usage with magrittr pipe
#> [1] "2018-02-14"

weeks_ago(2)  # equivalent to lubridate::today() - lubridate::days(2*7)
#> [1] "2018-02-07"
(2 %>% weeks_ago) # usage with magrittr pipe
#> [1] "2018-02-07"



days_hence(7)  # equivalent to lubridate::today() + lubridate::days(7)
#> [1] "2018-02-28"

hms("2017-10-22 15:33:00")  # extracts the time-of-day component
#> 15:33:00
```

## Why lubridateExtras?

Some people are probably asking the question: why lubridateExtras?

lubridateExtras does not do anything that you cannot do with lubridate
but similarly you donâ€™t need lubridate at all to work with date/times in
R\! If you like the syntactic sugar of lubridateExtras then use it,
otherwise stick with what works for you.
